				<h2>Mounting and Attaching Components</h2>
				
				<img style="float: right;" src="media\cpu.jpg" title="Installing a CPU" alt="Installing a CPU"><p>	Begin your build by mounting the power supply unit. Some cases come with a pre-installed unit. To attach the power supply, reference your case’s manual to see how the unit should be installed. Most cases have a shield that can attach to the back of the power supply and hold it in place on the back panel. The PSU typically slides into the back of the case, with the AC power connection and main power switch facing outward. If possible, make sure the fan on the unit is facing a direction where it can easily ventilate. After the PSU is secured, the motherboard can be assembled.</p>

				<p>	Begin the motherboard assembly with the CPU. If the motherboard includes a heatsink and fan for the CPU, dismount them first. Then, reference the motherboard’s manual to see where the lever(s) are for the brackets that keep the processor seated in the socket. Lift the levers. Unwrap the processor from its package, then carefully lift it by its edges. Align the pins on the bottom of the processor to the pinholes on the socket. Gently shake the board to ensure that the processor’s pins are fully inside the pinholes. Push the lever(s) back down to secure the CPU, then mount the heatsink and fan. (If the CPU didn’t come with thermal paste pre-applied, put a small amount on the side of the heatsink that will touch the processor. Spread it evenly using a plastic utensil.) After this, the RAM can be attached to the board. Check your motherboard’s manual to see what RAM slots should be used. (Different slots should be used depending on the amount of RAM on the board.) Once the slots have been located, take one RAM stick by its edges - be careful not to touch the gold contacts - and align it with the slot. Apply pressure to each end, pushing it into the board until it clicks into place on each end. Repeat this for the amount of RAM sticks you have.</p>
				<p>Now that the motherboard is assembled, it can be mounted within the case. Locate the standoff screws that the motherboard came with and screw them into the case. Then locate the I/O shield in the motherboard’s package, and snap it into place on the back panel of the case. (The I/O shield is a small panel that outlines the connectors on the edge of the motherboard and protects them.) Lower the motherboard into the case, aligning the screw holes with the standoffs and the connectors with the I/O shield. Screw the motherboard in place. (Don’t screw too tightly - this can crack the board.) </p>
				<p>Following the motherboard, the storage drives can be mounted. HDDs (typically) mount in the drive bay of the case. Reference the case’s manual if you have trouble locating the bay. The drives slide in place and screw into the side panel of the bay. (Plastic drive clips can also be used for holding drives in place.) SSDs usually have mounts on the chassis of the case, and their locations can be found in the manual. </p>
				<p>At this point, additional cards can be mounted. Expansion cards attach to the motherboard via PCI or PCIe slots. Locate the appropriate slot, then remove the shield on the back panel that is parallel to the slot. (Bend the shield away until it breaks off.) Align the connectors on the card with the slot and apply gentle pressure to ensure it that it’s seated properly. Attach the card to the back panel with a screw.</p>
