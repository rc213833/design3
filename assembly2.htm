				<h2>Connecting Components</h2>
				
				<img style="float: right;" src="media\connectors.jpg" title="Connector pins on a motherboard" alt="Connector pins on a motherboard"><p>	After all the components have been mounted within the case, power and data connections can be made. Find the power connection on your motherboard (reference manual if needed) and connect the appropriate power cable, typically a 24-pin cable. Connect power to your storage drives and any expansion cards on the motherboard. Make sure your CPU fan is connected to the motherboard. Locate the front panel cables within your case (connections for USBs, power button, etc.) and connect them to the motherboard.</p>

				<p>	Connect the storage drives to the motherboard with SATA cables. If you included optical drives, connect them as well. Verify that all components are connected, and that all connections are fully seated. Close the case up. Power the system by plugging the PSU into the wall with the supplied cable, then flipping the switch on the back of the unit and pressing the power button on the front of the case. Once youâ€™re sure the system boots up properly, start setting up your rig by installing an operating system.</p>
				<p>Taking care of your system over time is important to ensure that your machine is in healthy condition. Make sure to keep any magnets far away from any HDDs in your system, as they can interfere with the disks and corrupt data. Fans inside your case should be dusted regularly to allow for proper air circulation. Installing antivirus software on your system is a good practice to protect your computer and its data.
