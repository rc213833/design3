				<h2>Picking PSU and Storage</h2>
				
				<img style="float: right; height: 200px;" src="media\drives.png" title="Types of storage drives" alt="Types of storage drives"><p>	The power supply unit (PSU) of your system is another vital part of the build. The PSU should have sufficient wattage and an appropriate amount of connectors for all of your components. Reference your motherboardâ€™s specifications to see what wattage amounts you should look for. Some computer cases come with a PSU pre-installed. Many newer PSUs come in a modular form, meaning that unused or otherwise unnecessary power cables can be detached from the unit, reducing the amount of clutter within your system. Faulty or subpar PSUs can seriously harm your computer, so make sure yours is adequate.</p>

				<p>	Nowadays, computers can have (virtually) as much storage as the user wants. Storage drives come in two main forms: hard disk drives (HDD) or solid state drives (SSD). HDDs are the most pervasive, and are composed of a collection of magnetic disks that spin, and a moving arm that runs across the disks to read and write memory onto them. On the other hand, SSDs are non-volatile, meaning they have no moving parts. SSDs are made up of an array of storage chips and transistors. (Hybrids of SSDs and HDDs are available on the market.) Typically, HDDs tend to be less expensive than SSDs, and offer higher storage capacities for lower prices. Meanwhile, SSDs have faster read/write times than HDDs, are resistant to fragmenting data, and are more robust (less likely to break or malfunction than HDDs). Verify that your case and motherboard can accomodate for the selection of storage drives than you plan on using.</p>
